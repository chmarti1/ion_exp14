# Ion Experiment 14

In these tests, a 1/2in steel plate was heated while monitoring the current-voltage characteristic.  Tests were run in three configurations: (1) with preheat only, (2) in preheat with 0.1s bursts of 45psig cutting oxygen, and (3) in preheat with 0.1s bursts of 45psig cutting oxygen while applying a constant voltage.

## Configuration 0
Tests 5626 and 1045 were with no flame and with the 10uA reference current device.  These two tests are ONLY for calibration purposes.

## Configuration 1

Configuration 1 was in preheat only while monitoring the current-voltage characteristic.  These are test numbers 3309 through 0516, comprising eight (8) tests in all.  The first four (tests 3309 through 4437) were at a high flow rate (about 40scfh).  The last four (tests 5116 through 0516) were at a lower flow rate (about 30scfh).

## Configuration 2

Configuration 2 was in preheat while delivering 0.1s bursts of 45psig cutting oxygen every 19.9s, so the cycle is 20 seconds.  This was done while monitoring the current-voltage characteristic.

## Configuration 3

Configuration 3 is in preheat while delivering 0.1s bursts of 45psig cutting oxygen every 19.9s.  This was done while applying a constant 8V excitation.  This configuration was used on tests 3546 and 5109.  Because their data do not span the current-voltage characteristic, post1 post-processing data for them are not available.
